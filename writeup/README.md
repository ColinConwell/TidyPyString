# Quick Docs

`tidystring` is a toolbox for performing ready-to-use string operations on python strings -- whether they be single strings, lists of strings, or pandas Series typed as strings. These docs are generated by [pdoc](https://pdoc.dev/docs/pdoc.html), and are basically just an auto-generated walk-through of the code.

To get started, simply install the package (currenty, on GitHub):

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/ColinConwell/PyTidyString.git
```
